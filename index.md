# About Me

Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. I am grateful for the opportunity to work under the guidance of [Professor Samitha Samaranayake](https://cee.cornell.edu/samitha/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University, a master's degree from Wake Forest University, and a bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired extensive knowledge in applied probability, statistics, and mixed-integer optimization. I have been very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Amitabh Basu](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~abasu9/) at Johns Hopkins University and [Professor Kenneth Berenhaut](https://berenhaut.sites.wfu.edu/) at Wake Forest University.

## Research Interests

My research interests are diverse and interdisciplinary, encompassing probability, statistics, mixed-integer programming, and their applications in developing algorithms that offer both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency. I am dedicated to addressing the large-scale challenges faced by urban environments and driven by the demand for intellectual, sustainable, and equitable urban systems.
